                of the NBA, players who have staked their claim to the title of GOAT. The Eastern
                Conference has also had its share of controversy such as being considered a weak
                Conference, inferior to the west, none witch is true because the likes of Michael
                Jordan and Lebron James.

    <h1 class="text-center">Criteria To Be The Best</h1>
    <p class="text-center border border-danger" style="color: white; font-size: x-large; background-color: navy;">GOAT—
        Greatest of All Time. It is a term that we
        constantly hear in all
        aspects of society.
        No place is this term
        more widely used than in the world of sports, where fans spend days, months, or even years discussing who is the
        “greatest of all time.” The ongoing conversations regarding the GOATs of sports beg the question: What makes a
        player the GOAT? People argue that their favorite athletes are the greatest in the history of their sport, but
        on what grounds do they, and should they, make their claims? In response to these questions, we have compiled a
        list of criteria that we feel should be greatly considered when debating the GOAT: team accomplishments,
        individual accomplishments, impact on their sport, personal statistics, longevity of success, and their effect
        outside of their sport. Rarely will an athlete meet all six of these categories, but the few who do can
        certainly be considered as one of the greatest of all time Debating the greatest is always lots of fun but first
        we have to define the criteria for determining the GOAT. Is it just NBA performance that include MVPs,
        championships, All-Pro selections, all-star appearances, points scored, rebounds and assists? Does it include
        influence on the game of basketball outside the NBA, such as high school and college basketball? And should it
        include impact on the business of sport or even social activism? As the GOAT debate continues to simmer, my view
        is that it cannot be resolved in a truly objective manner. No one can agree on the criteria, context or what’s
        most important in settling this debate. Let’s just celebrate the evolution of the NBA and appreciate the one
        thing these amazing athletes share: They are truly remarkable on and off the basketball court.
